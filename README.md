# Movie-Knight
A Movie List and Review Webapp using a MERN Stack. Large Project for COP 4331 Spring 2023, Group 16.

# Front-end Setup
  - Source files for 'client' are located at /home/Movie-Knight/client on the MERN sever
  - "src" is the directory for the development (unimplemented) build
  - "build" is the directory for the for the current live build (Do not touch this)
  - "public" hold various html and front-end files (Function: TBD)
  - "node_modules) holds all the code for evey node module (Very Large Folder, Do not delete this)

# Front-end Commands
  - Perform all terminal commands at "/home/Movie-Knight/client"
  - To run a DEVELOPMENT server, run "npm start", this creates a test server at "{IP address}:3000" <-- (Enter this into a web browser)
  - To build a public build of the app, run "npm run build", the results will be located inside "build" and will display on the live version of the site

# Editing the Front-end
  - Pushing Code from the Repo to the MERN Stack, only copy/paste the 'src', 'public', 'build' folders
  - Install any new node modules from the terminal (NOT copy/paste)
  
# Other Useful Commands
   - "reboot" -- reboots the MERN droplet
   - "cd .." -- moves up a directory level
